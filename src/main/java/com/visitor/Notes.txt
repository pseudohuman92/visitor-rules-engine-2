- When you want to implement an ability that says "When {~} enters play, ..." and doesn't target,
    use 'addEnterPlayEffect' function from Card.java.

-Card.java automatically registers triggering cards when they enter play and deregisters them when they leave.
    Don't register them manually in their constructors.
